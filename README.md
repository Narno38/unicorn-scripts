===============

various scripts for the Unicorn Hat by Pimoroni (see https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat)

matrix.py
	a Matrix movie simulation, adapted from a code snippet found on the web (can't find anymore the source, if you are the author please message me for credits !)

cpu-gaussian.py
	runs like a heartbeat based on actual CPU usage of the RPi
	leverages snippets from the web as well
	note: utilises psutil (install with sudo pip install psutil)
